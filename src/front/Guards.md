# Guards

## AuthGuard

Input: props

Output: children

Description: This component is used to guard routes and ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing certain pages. It takes in a children prop which represents the content to be rendered if the user is authenticated.

The component uses the useRouter hook from Next.js to access the router object and the useAuthContext hook to check if the user is authenticated.

The ignore variable is a reference to keep track of whether the authentication check has already been performed. It is initially set to false.

The checked variable is a state variable that keeps track of whether the authentication check has been completed. It is initially set to false.

The component uses the useEffect hook to perform the authentication check when the component mounts. It only performs the check if the router is ready and if the authentication check has not already been performed. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects them to the login page. If the user is authenticated, it sets the checked state variable to true.

If the authentication check has not been completed (checked is false), the component returns null.

If the authentication check has been completed (checked is true), it renders the children prop.

The component also has a propTypes definition for the children prop, specifying that it should be a React node.
