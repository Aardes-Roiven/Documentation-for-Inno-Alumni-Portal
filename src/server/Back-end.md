## API
In the context of Python backend, an API (Application Programming Interface) refers to a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods, endpoints, and data formats that can be used to interact with a web service or application. In Python, APIs are commonly built using frameworks like Flask or Django, which handle the routing and processing of HTTP requests and responses.

## Schema
In Python backend development, a schema refers to a structure or blueprint that defines the organization and validation rules for data. It is commonly used in the context of database management systems or data serialization. For example, in the case of a relational database, a schema defines the tables, columns, relationships, and constraints that make up the database. In Python, libraries like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM provide tools for defining and managing database schemas.

## Telegram
Telegram is a cloud-based instant messaging platform that allows users to send messages, make voice and video calls, and share media files. In Python backend development, Telegram can be integrated into applications using the Telegram Bot API. This API provides methods for creating and managing bots that can interact with users on the Telegram platform. Python libraries like python-telegram-bot or telethon can be used to implement Telegram bot functionality in a Python backend.

## Utils
"Utils" is short for utilities or utility functions. In Python backend development, utils usually refers to a module or package containing a collection of helper functions or classes that provide common functionality used across the application. These utility functions may perform tasks such as data validation, file handling, string manipulation, date/time formatting, encryption/decryption, etc. Utils are often used to keep code modular and reusable, reducing duplication and improving code organization.
